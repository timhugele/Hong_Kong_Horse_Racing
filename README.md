### Data Source
* The data for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gdaley/hkracing). The original source of the data from Kaggle is the [Hong Kony Jockey Club](https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/english/index.aspx).

### Problem Summary
* Using the data from Kaggle we are attempting to predict which horses will come in first place from horse races in Hong Kong. We intend to use this information to profitably bet on horse racing. Our target audience is a group of investors who would want to have us bet money on their behalf.

### Metrics
* The metrics that we are using for our project are area under the curve and the proportion of true positives to false positives. We are using area under the curve as a metric because it incorporates both true positives and false positives in how it is measured. We think that these metrics are important because what matters most to us is how often our system tells us to make a bet on a particular horse and we are correct. The proportion of the times that we are correct to the times that we are incorrect when advised to bet determines our profitability.

### Key Takeaways
*

### Next Steps
* In the future we would like to collect more data. We believe that longer races will be easier to predict, however there are relatively fewer long races than shorter ones and more data will assist us in making good predictions on those races.
* We would also like more time to work on engineering new features. The engineering of features took up most of the time that we spent on this project, and we only stopped because we ran out of time.
